# GitHub Copilot Tests

Playing with GitHub Copilot.

## Motivation

I was just given access to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) and
played a bit with the AI suggestions.

## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI driven autocompletion/auto-suggestion feature, that can
be added to various editors and IDEs. It is made by GitHub (oviously). It is
more powerful than most traditional suggestion features, but there are also some
questions about the legal part.

You can read more about it on the [official site](https://copilot.github.com/).

## Results

TBD

## Contribute

The repository is just for experimenting a bit and playing with a GitHub
feature. I don't expect any contribution. Anyway, if you think you can add
something useful, I would be happy to check the PR or issue.
